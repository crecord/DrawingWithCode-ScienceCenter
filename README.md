Drawing with Code is a education station set up at the Carnegie Science Center to expose participants to a variety of creative means that they can create dynamic drawings with computer programming. 

All the examples use a language called processing which you can [download here]().


Drawing with Code is a workshop series intended to  expose participants to a variety of creative means that they can create dynamic drawings with computer programming. There are three sections: Making up the Rules, Creating Drawing Tools, and New Places to Put Drawings. The students jumped right into programming! They modified existing code examples that did everything from simulating how birds flock to using open source facial tracking to make drawings with their noses. 

Drawing with Code is a three part workshop series for the Ellis Girl's Middle School. The goal is to expose participants to a variety of creative means that they can create dynamic drawings with code. The workshop is built off of a previous workshop that I co-taught with Nathan Trevino in 2014. [Here](https://drawingwithcode.wordpress.com/) is our blog for the original workshop.     

This workshop has three sections, each of which has code examples and a short associated lecture.
Here are the three sections and links to their presentations:
