Drawing with Code is an education station set up at the Carnegie Science Center to expose participants to a variety of creative means that they can create dynamic drawings with computer programming. 
There are a bunch of fun examples to play with! There is everything from drawing with your nose to drawings that dance around when you scream at them.
